# stock-analysis

In this project I analyzed the stock data in excel using VBA to create macros which sifted through the data faster. I used VBA to create a summary of the stock data, focusing on the Ticker, Yearly Change, Percentage Change, and Total Stock Volume. Then I narrowed down the date more to include a summary of the summary data, showing the Greatest % Increase, Greatest % Decrease, and the Greatest Total Volume. 

+The macro is stored in a VBA file and can be used on any set of stock data in order to calculate the mentioned variables. In order to more efficiently create the macro, I used a smaller set of data, alphabetical_testing, and when that code was successful I used it on the bigger data set for the multiple year stock analysis.
